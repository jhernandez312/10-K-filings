We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\n&#160;\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\nChanges in Accounting Principles\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018.\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe conducted our audits i n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n&#160;\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n&#160;\n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n&#160;\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive Sales To Customers With a Resale Value Guarantee or Buyback Option\n\n&#160;\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the sales return reserve related to resale value guarantees or buyback options was $703 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $202 million was short-term. The Company offers some customers resale value guarantees or buyback options. Under these programs, the Company receives full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and the customer has the option of selling their vehicle back to the Company during the guarantee period for a pre-determined resale value. In circumstances where management does not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option provided to them at contract inception, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers upon delivery to a customer as a sale with a right of return. In circumstances where management believes the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option at contract inception, the Company recognizes the transaction as an operating lease. Management&#8217;s determination of whether there is a significant economic incentive includes comparing a vehicle&#8217;s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value. Sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the estimated future market values of vehicles under these programs, taking into account price adjustments on vehicle offerings and changes in market conditions subsequent to the initial sale to determine the need for changes to the reserve. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to automotive sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or buyback option is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive to exercise their option&#59; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive. \n\n&#160;\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to automotive revenue recognition for sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or buyback option as well as the related sales return reserve, including controls over management&#8217;s estimate of expected future market values and historical experience. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining whether customers have a significant economic incentive to exercise their put rights under the resale value guarantee and buyback option programs and, if not, the related sales return reserve. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to historical experience and the estimated expected future market values used in the comparison to guaranteed resale amounts. Evaluating assumptions related to historical experience and estimated expected future market values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance and consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Procedures were performed to evaluate the reliability, completeness and relevance of management&#8217;s data used in the development of the historical experience assumption. \n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\n\n&#160;\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $1,468 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company provides a manufacturer&#8217;s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. As described in Note 2, a warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management&#8217;s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty, including recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the warranty reserve&#59; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\n&#160;\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s estimate of the automotive warranty reserve, including controls over management&#8217;s estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance, including a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. These procedures also included developing an independent estimate of a portion of the warranty accrual, comparing the independent estimate to management&#8217;s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate, and testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims. Procedures were performed to test the reliability, completeness, and relevance of management&#8217;s data related to the historical claims processed and that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of aspects of management&#8217;s model for estimating the nature and frequency of future claims, and testing management&#8217;s warranty reserve for a portion of future warranty claims.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n&#160;\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nFebruary 8, 2021\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2005. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTesla, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(in millions, except per share data)\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAssets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n19,384 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,268 \n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,886 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,324 \n\n&#160;\n\nInventory\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,101 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,552 \n\n&#160;\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,346 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n26,717 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n12,103 \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease vehicles, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,091 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,447 \n\n&#160;\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,979 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,138 \n\n&#160;\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n12,747 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,396 \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,558 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,218 \n\n&#160;\n\nIntangible assets, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,536 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,470 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal assets\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n52,148 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n34,309 \n\n&#160;\n\nLiabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts payable\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,051 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,771 \n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued liabilities and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,855 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,222 \n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,458 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,163 \n\n&#160;\n\nCustomer deposits\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,132 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,785 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n14,248 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,667 \n\n&#160;\n\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,556 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n11,634 \n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,284 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,207 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,330 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,691 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n28,418 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n26,199 \n\n&#160;\n\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;

(&#8220;Tesla&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n\nAs of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic. In 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or close non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce. We cannot predict the duration or direction of such trends, which have also adversely affected and may in the future affect our operations. \n\nOn February 19, 2020, we completed a public offering of our common stock and issued a total of 15.2 million shares ( as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, as described in the paragraph below) , for total cash proceeds of $ 2.31 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of $ 28 million.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a five -for-one split of the Company&#8217;s common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend (the &#8220;Stock Split&#8221;). Each stockholder of record on August 21, 2020 received a dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, distributed after close of trading on August 28, 2020. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell $ 5.00 billion in shares of our common stock from time to time through an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering program. Such sales were completed by September 4, 2020 and settled by September 9, 2020, with the sale of 11,141,562 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 billion and net proceeds of $ 4.97 billion, net of sales agents&#8217; commissions of $ 25 million and other offering costs of $ 1 million.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, we entered into a separate Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell $ 5.00 billion in shares of our common stock from time to time through an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering program. Such sales were completed by December 9, 2020 and settled by December 11, 2020, with the sale of 7,915,589 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 billion and net proceeds of $ 4.99 billion, net of sales agents&#8217; commissions of $ 13 million and other offering costs of $ 1 million.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity&#59; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements ). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Restricted cash and MyPower customer notes receivable have been reclassified to other assets and resale value guarantees has been reclassified to other liabilities.\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160;\n\nAdoption of ASC 606 revenue standard \n\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective method.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue by source \n\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive sales without resale value guarantee\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n24,053 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n19,212 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n15,810 \n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive sales with resale value guarantee (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,403 \n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,580 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,477 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,056 \n\n&#160;\n\nServices and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,306 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,226 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,391 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues from sales and services\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n29,967 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n23,178 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n20,079 \n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive leasing\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,052 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n31,536 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n24,578 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n21,461 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\nDue to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020 and 2019, we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program, which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, price adjustments resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee by $ 72 million and $ 555 million, respectively. The amounts presented represent automotive sales with resale value guarantee net of such pricing adjustments&#8217; impact.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive Segment \n\nAutomotive Sales Revenue \n\nAutomotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee \n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self-Driving (&#8220;FSD&#8221;) features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer&#8217;s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n&#160;\n\nAutomotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option \n\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. \n\nWith the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the Automotive Leasing section below, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle&#8217;s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer&#8217;s economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $ 72 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $ 42 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net impact was $ 30 million reduction in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program was $ 703 million and $ 639 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of which $ 202 million and $ 93 million was short term, respectively. \n\nDeferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without\n\n&#160; resale value guarantee&#8212; beginning of period\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,472 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nAdditions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue recognized\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 326 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 300 \n\n)\n\nDeferred revenue on automotive sales with and without\n\n&#160; resale value guarantee&#8212; end of period\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,926 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,472 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of December 31, 2020. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019, revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 283 million. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $ 220 million. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of December 31, 2020, we expect to recognize $ 1.13 billion of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.\n\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits \n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. \n\n&#160;\n\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled $ 1.58 billion, $ 594 million and $ 419 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $ 21 million and $ 140 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to recognize the majority of the deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 in the next 12 months. \n\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue \n\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program \n\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $ 752 million, $ 532 million and $ 393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred $ 293 million and $ 218 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. \n\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. \n\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option \n\nWe offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases . These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606 , these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases , prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue . The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $ 42 million and $ 214 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including $ 23 &#160; million within a 12-month period from December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 , we had $ 42 million and $ 238 million, respectively, of such borrowings recorded in accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities and $ 11 &#160; million and $ 29 million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $ 77 million, $ 186 million and $ 332 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program. The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was $ 43 million and $ 190 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program \n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months. Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $ 120 million of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 87 million of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. \n\nServices and Other Revenue \n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales \n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers. Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and power purchase agreements (&#8220;PPAs&#8221;) that commence after January 1, 2019, which is recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. \n\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales . Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales . Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. A ny fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. \n\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 187 million and $ 156 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 was $ 34 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was $ 41 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2020, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 100 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 6 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 27 years.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing \n\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products , we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 206 million and $ 226 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to $ 29 million and $ 36 million, respectively.\n\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAutomotive Segment\n\nAutomotive Sales \n\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand . \n\nAutomotive Leasing \n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases, as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.\n\nServices and Other \n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services , costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers . \n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage \n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. \n\n&#160;\n\nLeases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases , as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach (&#8220;adoption of the new lease standard&#8221;). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. Accordingly, previously reported financial statements, including footnote disclosures, have not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard to all comparative periods presented. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840. \n\nResearch and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nMarketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. \n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance. \n\n&#160;\n\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and our employee stock purchase plan (the &#8220;ESPP&#8221;). The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations (see Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans ).\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (&#8220;HLBV&#8221;) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties&#8217; interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in the ending balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached.\n\nNet Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we decreased net income attributable to common stockholders by $ 31 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net income per share. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased net loss attributable to common stockholders by $ 8 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net loss per share. These adjustments represent the difference between the cash we paid to the financing fund investors for their noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding under our 0.25 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 (&#8220;2019 Notes&#8221;), 1.25 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 (&#8220;2021 Notes&#8221;), 2.375 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 (&#8220;2022 Notes&#8221;), 2024 Notes and our subsidiary&#8217;s 5.50 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 , we use the treasury stock method applied using our average share price during the period when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any . Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 12, Debt ). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. Warrants which have a strike price above our average share price during the period were out of the money and were not included in the tables below. Warrants will be included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted average shares used in computing\n\n&#160; net income (loss) per share of common\n\n&#160; stock, basic\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdd:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based awards\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\nConvertible senior notes\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\nWarrants\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted average shares used in computing\n\n&#160; net income (loss) per share of common stock,\n\n&#160; diluted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,083 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based awards\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nConvertible senior notes\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWarrants\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations . The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds.\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing facilities and certain operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\n\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n19,384 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,268 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,686 \n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses\n\n&#160; and other current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n19,901 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,783 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,277 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\n&#160;\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them . These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period . \n\nMyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower was offered by one of our subsidiaries to provide residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30 -year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as other non-current assets for the long-term portion. We adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses , on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, expected credit loss for customer notes receivable are measured on a collective basis and are determined as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. We write-off customer notes receivable when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant. Using a modified retrospective approach for the impact upon adoption, we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $ 37 million on January 1, 2020, with an offset to accumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was $ 334 million and $ 402 million, respectively, of which $ 9 million was due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $ 45 million. In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2020.\n\nConcentration of Risk\n\nCredit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no entity represented 10 % or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\nSupply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAlthough all of our manufacturing facilities are operational, and we continue to increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production, our ability to sustain this trajectory depends, among other things, on the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors through any macroeconomic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program and vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option where there is significant economic incentive to exercise at contract inception are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases under ASC 842 ( refer to the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details ). Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their value, less salvage value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 3.54 billion and $ 2.85 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 446 million and $ 406 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nSolar Energy Systems, Net \n\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Prior to January 1, 2019, these leases were accounted for as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840. Under ASC 840, to determine lease classification, we evaluated the lease terms to determine whether there was a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term was greater than 75 % of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90 % of the fair value at lease inception. Agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019 no longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption of ASC 842 and are instead accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Solar energy systems in service\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n30 to 35 years \n\nInitial direct costs related to customer\n\n&#160; solar energy system lease acquisition\n\n&#160; costs\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLease term (up to 25 years) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Machinery, equipment, vehicles and\n\n&#160; office furniture\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2 to 12 years \n\nBuilding and building improvements\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15 to 30 years \n\nComputer equipment and software\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3 to 10 years \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\n\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\n\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\n\n&#160;\n\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have recognized certain impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 22, Restructuring and Other , for further details). \n\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to thirty years .\n\nGoodwill\n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had no t recognized any impairment of goodwill.\n\nCapitalization of Software Costs\n\nFor costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage to property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years . We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\n\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $ 114 million, gains of $ 48 million and gains of $ 2 million, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nWarranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer&#8217;s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance was primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued warranty&#8212;beginning of period\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,089 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nWarranty costs incurred\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 312 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 250 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 209 \n\n)\n\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties,\n\n&#160; including expirations and foreign exchange impact\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 26 \n\n)\n\nAdditional warranty accrued from adoption of ASC 606\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProvision for warranty\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued warranty&#8212;end of period\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,468 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,089 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nSolar Renewable Energy Credits\n\nWe account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (&#8220;SRECs&#8221;) when they are purchased by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue.\n\nNevada Tax Incentives\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $ 195.0 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the incentive. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had earned the maximum of $ 195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements. \n\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20 -year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 - 80 % of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10 -year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. As of December 31, 2020, we had no t yet received any grant funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses, and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, the ASU requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have not early adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848). The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We will evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity&#8217;s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470- 20, Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\n\nWe will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2021 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption is expected to reduce additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) by approximately $ 475 million and $ 50 million, respectively for the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, which was initially separated and recorded in equity, remove the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation for approximately $ 269 million and reduce property, plant and equipment for previously capitalized interest by approximately $ 45 million, as a result. The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2021.\n\nWe currently expect the adoption of the ASU will result in the reduction of non-cash interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2021 and until the affected notes have been settled, before the impact of reduction of our interest capitalization, which is not expected to be material. The reduction of depreciation expense through cost of goods sold is not expected to be material for the year ending December 31, 2021. These reduced expenses will increase the income attributable to common stockholders for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The required use of the if converted method is not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalents included in the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and our subsidiary&#8217;s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022. The amendments to the derivative accounting guidance are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption will have no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements \n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2020 . The ASUs did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-13 applies to all financial assets including loans, trade receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact except on MyPower customer notes receivable. Refer to MyPower Customer Notes Receivable above for further details.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020 . The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020 . The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 3 &#8211; Business Combinations\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed various acquisitions for which consideration was immaterial on an individual basis and in aggregate.\n\nMaxwell Acquisition\n\nOn May 16, 2019 (the &#8220;Acquisition Date&#8221;), we completed our strategic acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Maxwell&#8221;), an energy storage and power delivery products company, for its complementary technology and workforce. Pursuant to the related Agreement and Plan of Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock was converted into 0.0965 (the &#8220;Exchange Ratio&#8221;) shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . In addition, Maxwell&#8217;s stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. \n\nFair Value of Purchase Consideration\n\nThe Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was $ 207 million ( as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, 4,514,840 shares issued at $ 45.90 per share, the opening price of our common stock on the Acquisition Date).\n\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n\n&#160;\n\nWe accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. \n\nFair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price was based on management&#8217;s estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Assets acquired:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts receivable\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInventory\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIntangible assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPrepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal assets acquired\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLiabilities and equity assumed:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts payable\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 10 \n\n)\n\nAccrued liabilities and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 28 \n\n)\n\nDebt and finance leases, current and non-current\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 44 \n\n)\n\nDeferred revenue, current\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 1 \n\n)\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 14 \n\n)\n\nAdditional paid-in capital\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 \n\n)\n\nTotal liabilities and equity assumed\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 105 \n\n)\n\nNet assets acquired\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal purchase price\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from integrating Maxwell&#8217;s technology into our automotive segment as well as the acquired talent.

Total consideration for these acquisitions was $ 96 million, of which $ 80 million was paid in cash. In aggregate, $ 36 million was attributed to intangible assets, $ 51 million was attributed to goodwill within the automotive segment, and $ 9 million was attributed to net assets assumed. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were related to purchased technology, with estimated useful lives of one to nine years . \n\nStandalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements, either individually or in aggregate.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 4 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill increased $ 9 million within the automotive segment from $ 198 million as of December 31, 2019 to $ 207 million as of December 31, 2020 due to completed business combinations and foreign currency translation adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nASC 820 , Fair Value Measurements , states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability . The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets&#59; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data.

We are currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $ 48 million and $ 31 million, respectively, of interest.\n\nDepreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 1.57 billion, $ 1.37 billion and $ 1.11 billion, respectively. Gross property, plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 2.28 billion and $ 2.08 billion, respectively, with accumulated depreciation of $ 816 million and $ 483 million, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nPanasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $ 1.77 billion and $ 1.73 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement. \n\nIn 2019, the Shanghai government agreed to provide $ 85 million of certain incentives in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai, of which $ 46 million was received in cash and the remaining $ 39 million was in the form of assets and services contributed by the government. In 2020, the Shanghai government agreed to provide an additional $ 122 million of such incentives. Of the total incentives provided between both years, $ 123 million was received in cash in 2020. Proceeds from the grant must be spent on qualified capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai as stipulated in the agreement. These incentives were taken as a reduction to property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets and cash receipts are reflected as investing cash inflows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 9 &#8211; Accrued Liabilities and Other\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued purchases (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nTaxes payable (2)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPayroll and related costs\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued warranty reserve, current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSales return reserve, current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued interest\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nResale value guarantees, current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,855 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,222 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nAccrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services that we had not been invoiced yet.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2020, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum liquidity and expense-coverage balances and ratios.\n\n2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn March 2014, we issued $ 1.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Notes in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $ 180 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options by the underwriters. The total net proceeds from the issuances, after deducting transaction costs, were $ 1.36 billion.\n\nAs adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $ 1,000 of principal of these notes is now convertible into 13.8940 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 71.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes have been able to elect to convert on or after December 1, 2020. The settlement of such an election to convert the outstanding notes would be in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election. As of December 1, 2020, holders of these notes have the option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert prior to December 1, 2020 under the circumstances further described below. &#160; &#160; &#160; Upon the early conversion of the 2021 Notes, we will pay cash for the principal amount and deliver shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the applicable maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. \n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these notes. We recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity $ 369 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 5.96 %.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn connection with the offering of these notes in March and April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 71.97 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $ 398 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . We received $ 257 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of these warrants. Taken together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges and the sales of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or cash payments from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion from $ 71.97 to $ 112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders&#8217; equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDuring each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 % of the applicable conversion price of the 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2021 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes is in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election, we reclassified $ 3 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes and the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The debt discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense through March 2021 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through December 31, 2020, including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $ 958 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes were converted for $ 958 million in cash and 11.1 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $ 6 million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the notes, resulting in the receipt of 11.1 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the related convertible debt. The remaining notes outstanding are expected to convert in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the 2021 Notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $ 3.71 billion. \n\n2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn March 2017, we issued $ 978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $ 966 million.\n\nAs adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $ 1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price&#59; (2) during the five-business day period following any five -consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98 % of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, the 2022 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. \n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity $ 146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00 %.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 65.50 per share as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $ 204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 131.00 per share. We received $ 53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $ 65.50 to $ 131.00 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders&#8217; equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nDuring each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 % of the applicable conversion price of the 2022 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2022 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2022 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified $ 115 million of the carrying value of the 2022 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $ 5 million, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal of our 2022 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes would be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the remaining liability is classified as non-current. The debt discounts recorded on the 2022 Notes are recognized as interest expense through March 2022 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through December 31, 2020, including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $ 474 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes were converted for $ 474 million in cash and 6.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $ 5 million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 6.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $ 4.92 billion. \n\n2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions\n\nIn May 2019, we issued $ 1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $ 1.82 billion.\n\nAs adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $ 1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is convertible into 16.1380 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 61.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price on each trading day&#59; (2) during the five-business day period after any five -consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. \n\nIn accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2024 Notes. We recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity $ 491 million for the conversion feature. The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 8.68 %.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 29.7 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 61.97 per share as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $ 476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 29.7 million shares of our common stock at a price of $ 121.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split . We received $ 174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $ 61.97 to $ 121.50 per share.

As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2024 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified $ 171 million, of the carrying value of the 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $ 43 million, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal of our 2024 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.

The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 8.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $ 1.77 billion.\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1 % plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 %, (ii) the lenders&#8217; &#8220;prime rate&#8221; or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25 % per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. \n\nIn March 2020, we upsized the Credit Agreement by $ 100 million, which matures July 2023 , to $ 2.525 billion. In June 2020, $ 197 million of commitment under the Credit Agreement expired in accordance with its terms and the total commitment decreased to $ 2.328 billion &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160;\n\nZero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020\n\nIn December 2015, SolarCity Corporation (&#8220;SolarCity&#8221;) issued $ 113 million in aggregate principal amount of Zero -Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on December 1, 2020 in a private placement. $ 13 million of these notes were issued to related parties.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $ 1,000 of principal of these notes was convertible into 16.6665 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 60.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate is capped at 21.1538 shares for each $1,000 of principal of these notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $ 47.27 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The holders of these notes were able to require us to repurchase their notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. On or after June 30, 2017, these notes are redeemable by us in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200 % of the conversion price for 45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days of such redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $ 103 million in aggregate principal amount of these notes were converted for 1.7 &#160; million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of the Maxwell Notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $ 447 million.\n\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\n\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs&#8217; expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs&#8217; assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

The SPEs&#8217; assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\n\nWarehouse Agreements\n\nIn August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (as amended from time to time, the &#8220;2016 Warehouse Agreement&#8221;) for borrowings secured by the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On August 17, 2017, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the maturity date, and our subsidiaries entered into another loan and security agreement (the &#8220;2017 Warehouse Agreement&#8221;) with substantially the same terms as and that shared the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend the availability periods thereunder from August 17, 2018 to August 16, 2019 and extend the maturity dates from September 2019 to September 2020 .

Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreements generally bear or bore interest at a fixed margin above (i) LIBOR or (ii) the commercial paper rate. The Warehouse Agreements are or were non-recourse to our other assets.\n\nIn August 2020, one of our subsidiaries terminated the 2018 Warehouse Agreement after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, leaving the 2016 Warehouse Agreement as the only remaining Warehouse Agreement. In August 2020, we further amended and restated the 2016 Warehouse Agreement to extend the maturity date to September 2022. The 2016 Warehouse Agreement currently has an aggregate lender commitment of $ 1.10 billion, the same amount as the aggregate lender commitment previously shared with the 2018 Warehouse Agreement prior to the termination of the latter.\n\nPursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased vehicles has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not required to pay obligations under the Warehouse Agreements are or were available for distributions. &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSolar Term Loans \n\nOur subsidiaries have entered into agreements for term loans with various financial institutions.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. \n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\n\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years . Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. \n\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1, 2019. For historical leases, we used the index or rate as of January 1, 2019. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term in interest expense. \n\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as

The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 3.25 billion, $ 502 million and $ 546 million, respectively.\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $ 1.55 billion, $ 237 million and $ 293 million, respectively.\n\nESPP\n\nOur employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 % of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 1.8 million, 2.5 million and 2.0 million shares under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. There were 34.3 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2020.\n\nFair Value Assumptions\n\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.26 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2.4 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2.5 \n\n%\n\nExpected term (in years)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3.9 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4.5 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4.7 \n\n&#160;\n\nExpected volatility\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\nDividend yield\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.0 \n\n%\n\nGrant date fair value per share (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n216.14 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n22.32 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n24.38 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\nPrior period results have been adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. See Note 1, Overview , for details.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant&#8217;s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\n2018 CEO Performance Award \n\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors&#8217; grant of 101.3 million stock option awards to our CEO (the &#8220;2018 CEO Performance Award&#8221;), as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $ 100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $ 50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $ 70.01 per share as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding. \n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2020 was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Total Annualized Revenue\n\n&#160;\n\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\n\nMilestone\n\n(in billions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchievement Status\n\n&#160;\n\nMilestone\n\n(in billions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchievement Status\n\n$\n\n20.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchieved and certified \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1.5 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchieved and certified \n\n$\n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProbable \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchieved and certified \n\n$\n\n55.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.5 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAchieved and certified \n\n$\n\n75.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProbable \n\n$\n\n100.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n8.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProbable \n\n$\n\n125.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n10.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n$\n\n150.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n$\n\n175.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n14.0 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles.\n\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its &#8220;expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.&#8221; Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone, or its &#8220;expected operational milestone achievement time.&#8221; When we first determine that an operational milestone has become probable of being achieved, we allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the then-applicable &#8220;expected vesting time.&#8221; The &#8220;expected vesting time&#8221; at any given time is the later of (i) the expected operational milestone achievement time (if the related operational milestone has not yet been achieved) and (ii) the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time (if the related market capitalization milestone has not yet been achieved). We immediately recognize a catch-up expense for all accumulated expense for the quarters from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved. Each quarter thereafter, we recognize the prorated portion of the then-remaining expense for the tranche based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the then-applicable expected vesting time, except that upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized. \n\nAs a result, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant catch-up expenses in quarters when one or more operational milestones are first determined to be probable of being achieved. Additionally, the expected market capitalization achievement times are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement times. Therefore, if market capitalization milestones are achieved earlier than originally forecasted, for example due to periods of rapid stock price appreciation, this has resulted, and may result in the future, in higher catch-up expenses and the remaining expenses being recognized over shorter periods of time at a higher per-quarter rate.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2020, the first tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestone of $ 100.0 billion and the operational milestone of $ 20.0 billion annualized revenue had been achieved. Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $ 22 million for that tranche, which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the grant date, was accelerated into the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 4.5 billion became probable of being achieved during the second quarter of 2020 and consequently, we recognized a catch-up expense of $ 79 million in that quarter. &#160;\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2020, the second and third tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestones of $ 150.0 billion and $ 200.0 billion and the operational milestones of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 1.5 billion and annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 3.0 billion had been achieved. Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $ 95 million and $ 118 million associated with the second and third tranches, respectively, which were previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the grant date were accelerated into the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 6.0 billion became probable of being achieved during the third quarter of 2020 and consequently, we recognized a catch-up expense of $ 77 million in that quarter. &#160;\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the fourth tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestone of $ 250.0 billion and the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 4.5 billion had been achieved. Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $ 122 million for that tranche, which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters through the third quarter of 2023 as determined on the grant date, was accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $ 8.0 billion became probable of being achieved and consequently, we recognized a catch-up expense of $ 75 million in that quarter . \n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $ 264 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered either probable of achievement or achieved but not yet certified, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.6 years. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 712 million for the operational milestones that were considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $ 838 million, $ 296 million and $ 175 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\n\n2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards\n\nIn 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders&#8217; interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees (excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 5.4 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n1/4 th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle&#59;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period&#59;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle&#59; and\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30 % for any three-year period.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following performance milestones had been achieved:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCompletion of the first Model X production vehicle&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCompletion of the first Model 3 production vehicle&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 4 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did no t record any additional stock-based compensation related to the 2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards.\n\n&#160;\n\n2012 CEO Performance Award \n\nIn August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 26.4 million stock option awards to our CEO (the &#8220;2012 CEO Performance Award&#8221;), as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $ 4.00 billion, as compared to our initial market capitalization of $ 3.20 billion at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2020, the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSuccessful completion of the Model X alpha prototype&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSuccessful completion of the Model X beta prototype&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCompletion of the first Model X production vehicle&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAggregate production of 100,000 vehicles&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSuccessful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSuccessful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCompletion of the first Model 3 production vehicle&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAggregate production of 200,000 vehicles&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAggregate production of 300,000 vehicles. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 6 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did no t record any additional stock-based compensation expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award.

The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $ 974 million, increased by $ 150 million, and decreased by $ 38 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have net $ 260 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have material release of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors, including the results of operations and magnitude of excess tax deductions for stock-based compensation. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deduction available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTax at statutory federal rate\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 139 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 211 \n\n)\n\nState tax, net of federal benefit\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNondeductible executive compensations\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOther nondeductible expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nExcess tax benefits related to stock based\n\n&#160; compensation\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 666 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 7 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 44 \n\n)\n\nForeign income rate differential\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. tax credits\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 181 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 107 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 80 \n\n)\n\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable\n\n&#160; noncontrolling interests adjustment\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 29 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGILTI inclusion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\nConvertible debt\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 4 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange in valuation allowance\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $ 9.65 billion of federal and $ 6.60 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2031 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had research and development tax credits of $ 417 million and $ 373 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 . However, the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $ 167 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 .\n\nFederal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.\n\nThe local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 % to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25 % statutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15 % for 2019 through 2023.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.\n\n&#160;\n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2017\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 6 \n\n)\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n\n&#160; positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 39 \n\n)\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n\n&#160; positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax\n\n&#160; positions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. Unrecognized tax benefits of $ 353 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance. \n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S., California and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2014 and 2019 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years 2004 to 2019 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2019 remain subject to examination in other U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. However, we cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time. \n\nThe U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit) reversed the Tax Court decision and upheld the validity of Treas. Reg. Section 1.482-7A(d)(2), requiring stock-based compensation costs be included in the costs shared under a cost sharing agreement. On June 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court denied to review the Ninth Circuit decision. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s denial, Tesla has already included stock-based compensation in cost sharing allocation agreement and hence retains its position . \n\nNote 16 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies\n\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the &#8220;SUNY Foundation&#8221;) with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. The SUNY Foundation covered (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to $ 350 million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $ 275 million and (iii) $ 125 million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York&#59; and we were responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The SUNY Foundation owns the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the manufacturing facility, we have commenced leasing of the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years, with an option to renew, for $ 2.00 per year plus utilities. \n\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $ 5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $ 41 million &#8220;program payment&#8221; to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a one-year deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on April 30, 2020, which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020. Moreover, we had exceeded our investment and employment obligations under this agreement prior to such mandated reduction of operations. We do not currently expect any issues meeting all applicable future obligations under this agreement. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.\n\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government&#8217;s standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nSecurities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition\n\nBetween September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (&#8220;SolarCity&#8221;). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, and costs. On January &#160; 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants&#8217; motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On March &#160; 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December &#160; 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On March &#160; 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party , was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction to selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the securities litigation related to the acquisition of SolarCity . On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs&#8217; previously-filed motion and granted in part and denied in part defendants&#8217; previously-filed motion. Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The current tentative dates for the trial are from July 12 to July 23, 2021, subject to change based on any further safety measures implemented by the Court. \n\nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April &#160; 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.\n\nWe believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.\n\n&#160;\n\nSecurities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles \n\nOn October &#160; 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May &#160; 4, 2016 to October &#160; 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding Tesla&#8217;s preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March &#160; 23, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May &#160; 25, 2018. The court granted defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on July 17, 2019 filed their opening brief. We filed our opposition on September 16, 2019. A hearing on the appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (&#8220;Ninth Circuit&#8221;) was held on April 30, 2020. On January 26, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court&#8217;s dismissal of the stockholder claims. We continue to believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\nOn October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Tesla, Elon Musk, and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities by Tesla in August 2017. The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of 2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court. On January 22, 2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the above-referenced earlier filed federal case. On February 5, 2019, the Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in such earlier filed federal case. After such earlier filed federal case was dismissed, defendants filed a motion on July 2, 2019 to dismiss this case as well. This case is now stayed pending a ruling from the Ninth Circuit on the earlier filed federal case with an agreement that if defendants prevail on appeal in such case, this case will be dismissed. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\n\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint&#59; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018 and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Our answer was filed on December 3, 2019, and trial is set for April 2022. Fact discovery is ongoing. We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\nLitigation Related to Directors&#8217; Compensation\n\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla&#8217;s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is set for September 2022, and fact discovery is ongoing. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\n&#160;\n\nSecurities Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction \n\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk&#8217;s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla&#8217;s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April 15, 2020, the Court denied defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial is set for May 2022. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these claims.\n\nBetween October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction. In addition to these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. The Courts in both the Delaware federal court and Delaware Court of Chancery actions have consolidated their respective actions and stayed each consolidated action pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits.\n\nBeginning on March 7, 2019, various stockholders filed derivative suits in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, naming Mr. Musk and Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted, also related to Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that is the basis of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action, as well as to Mr. Musk&#8217;s February 19, 2019 Twitter post regarding Tesla&#8217;s vehicle production. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and other relief. Plaintiffs agreed to a stipulation that these derivative cases would be stayed pending the outcome of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In March 2019, plaintiffs in one of these derivative suits moved to lift the stay and for an expedited trial. Briefs were filed on March 13, 2019, and the hearing was held on March 18, 2019. Defendants prevailed, with the Court denying the plaintiffs&#8217; request for an expedited trial and granting defendants&#8217; request to continue to stay this suit pending the outcome of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On May 4, 2020, the same plaintiffs again filed a motion requesting to lift the stay and for an expedited trial. Briefs were filed on May 13, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and a hearing was held on May 19, 2020. Defendants again prevailed, with the Court denying plaintiffs&#8217; request to lift the stay and for an expedited trial. The plaintiffs also sought leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted. The Court entered an order implementing its ruling on May 21, 2020. The amended complaint asserts additional allegations of breach of fiduciary duty related to two additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, dated July 29, 2019 and May 1, 2020, and seeks unspecified damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits.\n\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\n\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn particular, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Elon Musk&#8217;s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and (b) certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. On December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the projections and other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and (ii) issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Tesla&#8217;s regular financing arrangements . Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates.\n\nAside from the settlement, as amended, with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk&#8217;s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position, and brand. \n\nIndemnification and Guaranteed Returns\n\nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility (&#8220;ITC&#8221;s). Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) for purposes of claiming ITCs. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date.\n\nThe maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs. We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine exactly how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs, we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date. \n\nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state&#8217;s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received. \n\nLetters of Credit\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $ 233 million of unused letters of credit outstanding. \n\n&#160;\n\nNote 17 &#8211; Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation . We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\n\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\n\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor&#8217;s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\n\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\n\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund&#8217;s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs&#8217; assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAssets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease vehicles, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,183 \n\n&#160;\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,749 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,030 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal assets\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n5,151 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,602 \n\n&#160;\n\nLiabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued liabilities and other\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCustomer deposits\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,346 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,516 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,418 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,577 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 18 &#8211; Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation\n\nThrough December 31, 2020, we had entered into eight transactions referred to as &#8220;lease pass-through fund arrangements&#8221;. Under these arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years . These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years. These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.05 billion. The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 137 million and $ 101 million, respectively. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2020 was $ 68 million, of which $ 41 million is classified as a current liability. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $ 94 million, of which $ 57 million was classified as a current liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nUnder a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs, which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately. We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing obligation, which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates. A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed in-service and the associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors. In addition, we are responsible for any warranties, performance guarantees, accounting and performance reporting. Furthermore, we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements, regardless of whether the cash is received by us or directly by the investors.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for each of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 2021\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThereafter\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nFor two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for its obligations under the contractual agreements.\n\nEach lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placed-in-service dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon date. As part of this mechanism, the master lease prepayment amount is updated, and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease pass-through financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 19 &#8211; Defined Contribution Plan\n\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did no t make any contributions to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation).\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 20 &#8211; Related Party Transactions\n\nIn November 2018, our CEO purchased from us 284,575 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a per share price equal to the last closing price of our stock prior to the execution of the purchase agreement for an aggregate $ 20 million, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.\n\nIn May 2019, our CEO purchased from us 514,400 shares of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $ 25 million, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.\n\nIn February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from us 65,185 and 6,250 shares, respectively, of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $ 10 million and $ 1 million, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.\n\nIn June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an interim term of 90 days. During the interim term, we resumed our annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we obtained a binding market quote for a directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $ 100 million. \n\nPursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal funds, directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; indemnity coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $ 100 million. In return, we paid our CEO a total of $ 3 million, which represents the market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50 %. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance policy with third-party carriers.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 2 1 &#8211; Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas \n\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.

As a result, we recognized $ 50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments. We recognized $ 47 million in impairment related to the IPR&#38;D intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts and $ 15 million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a loss of $ 37 million for closing operations in certain facilities. On the statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges. The employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019, while the remaining amounts were non-cash.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized $ 37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The employee termination cash expenses of $ 27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $ 55 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of the IPR&#38;D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $ 13 million. We recognized settlement and legal expenses of $ 30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 23 &#8211; Subsequent Events\n\n&#160;\n\nEarly Conversions of Convertible Senior Notes\n\nBetween January 1, 2021 and February 5, 2021, we have received additional conversion notices on our 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes for $ 62 million and $ 623 million in aggregate principal amounts, respectively, for which we intend to settle the principal amounts in cash during the three months ended March 31, 2021.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments\n\nIn January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $ 1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\n\nWe will account for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles&#8211;Goodwill and Other . The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition. We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of operations. \n\nThe cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. Gains (if any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 24 &#8211; Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\n\nThe following table presents selected quarterly results of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 31\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJune 30\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSeptember 30\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n5,985 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,036 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n8,771 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n10,744 \n\n&#160;\n\nGross profit\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,234 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,267 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,063 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,066 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet income attributable to common\n\n&#160; stockholders\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nNet income per share of common stock\n\n&#160; attributable to common stockholders, basic (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.02 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.11 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.32 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.28 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet income per share of common stock\n\n&#160; attributable to common stockholders, diluted (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.02 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.10 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.27 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.24 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,541 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,350 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,303 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,384 \n\n&#160;\n\nGross profit\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,191 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,391 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet (loss) income attributable to common\n\n&#160; stockholders\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 702 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 408 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\n\n&#160; attributable to common stockholders, basic (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 0.82 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 0.46 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.12 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet (loss) income per share of common stock\n\n&#160; attributable to common stockholders, diluted (1)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 0.82 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 0.46 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n0.11 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPrior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.
